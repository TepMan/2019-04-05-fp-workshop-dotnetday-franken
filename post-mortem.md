# Post-Mortem

## Positive Feedback

- assisted mob programming
- good introduction to complicated subject

## Improvement needed

We, as teachers, failed demonstrating applicative validation. :-(

## Ideas for future

- Simplify example/demo so that core concepts are easier to grasp
- Practice many more different combinations of map/bind/apply to prevent looking stupid
